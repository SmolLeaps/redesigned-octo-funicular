Algo Pair Programming 

The title doesn't mean anything - github suggested it.

150 qns of 16 patterns

## Workflow
1. At the start of each session, create a folder in the following format: ddmmyyyy_[code pattern]_[qn title or learning point]
2. Each folder contains a python file and an optional readme to elaborate on problem spaces that cannot be described in code 


Each python file must contain the following:
- complexity and explanation
- summary of lib methods used
- algo

Each readme could contain images or links to resources/leetcode counterparts
